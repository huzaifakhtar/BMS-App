# JBD BMS Connection Debug Guide

Based on your issue "not able to see monitor screen with data", here's a step-by-step debugging approach:

## Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check BLE Connection Status**
- Open the app and connect to your JBD BMS device
- Verify you see "Connected to [Device Name]" message
- Navigate to Battery Monitor screen

### 2. **Use Debug Menu Options**
Once in the Battery Monitor screen, tap the menu (‚ãÆ) in the top-right corner and try these options in order:

#### A. **üîç Debug Connection**
- This generates a comprehensive connection report in the console
- Shows BLE services, characteristics, and callback status
- **Expected output:** You should see services discovered and characteristics identified

#### B. **Console Test - DD A5 03 00 FF FD 77**
- Sends the exact JBD command you specified
- Provides detailed console output showing:
  - Command being sent (hex format)
  - Raw response chunks received
  - Complete packet assembly
  - Parsed battery data

### 3. **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: No Services Found**
**Symptoms:** Debug shows no JBD-compatible services
**Solutions:**
- Try different BLE characteristic UUIDs
- Some JBD devices use different service UUIDs
- Check if device requires pairing/bonding first

#### **Issue 2: Services Found but No Data**
**Symptoms:** Write successful but no response received
**Solutions:**
- BMS might need initialization sequence
- Try different baud rate equivalent commands
- Some BMS devices require specific timing between commands

#### **Issue 3: Fragmented Responses**
**Symptoms:** "Response timeout - incomplete packet" errors
**Solutions:**
- App has built-in response buffering for this
- Increase timeout in `_responseTimeout` duration
- Some BMS devices send data in multiple chunks

### 4. **Console Output Analysis**

When using "Console Test", look for these patterns:

**‚úÖ SUCCESS Pattern:**
```
üì§ SENDING COMMAND:
Hex: DD A5 03 00 FF FD 77
üì• RAW RESPONSE CHUNK (X bytes):
Hex: DD A5 03 17 [battery data] [checksum] 77
‚úÖ BASIC INFO PARSED SUCCESSFULLY:
üîã Voltage: XX.XX V
‚ö° Current: X.XX A
üìä State of Charge: XX%
```

**‚ùå FAILURE Patterns:**
```
‚è∞ RESPONSE TIMEOUT - Incomplete packet in buffer
‚ùå PACKET TOO SHORT: X bytes (minimum 7 required)
‚ùå Checksum verification failed
```

### 5. **Manual Testing**

If app debugging doesn't work, try:
1. Use a BLE scanner app to verify your device advertises correct services
2. Check if device name contains "JBD" or "BMS"
3. Verify device is not connected to another app simultaneously

### 6. **Advanced Debugging**

Edit the BLE service to try different characteristic UUIDs:
- Common JBD UUIDs: FF00-0001, FF00-0002
- Generic UART: 6E400001, 6E400002, 6E400003
- Some devices use: FFF0, FFF1, FFF2

## Next Steps

1. Run the "üîç Debug Connection" first
2. Share the console output here
3. Based on the results, we can identify the specific issue
4. If needed, we'll modify the characteristic discovery logic

The app has comprehensive debugging built-in specifically for this issue!
